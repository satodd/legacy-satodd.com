			<h2> Education </h2>
			<p> I am currently on track on graduating with a Bachelor of Science
			with a major in Computing Science (and a minor in Classics) at the 
			University of Alberta graduating in April of 2016. I switched into the
			program, after partially completing an arts degree in Art and Design.
			</p>
			
			<p> I am in computer science at the University of Alberta, graduating
			in April of 2016. I hope to pursue design and programming in a career 
			upon graduating. I am constantly trying to grow as a developer in my
			professional career. 
			</p>
			
			<p> Languages I have knowledge in 
				<ul>
					<li>HTML</li>
					<li>CSS</li>
					<li>Java</li>
					<li>Python</li>
					<li>SQL</li>
					<li>Prolog</li>
					<li>Lisp</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<p> Design-wise, I enjoy bright colours and patterns. I have some 
			background in art and design through courses at the University of Alberta.
			I truly enjoy creating and bringing things to life. I have working knowledge in 
			Sketch for design purposes.

			<h2> Interests </h2>
			<p> Besides programming, I enjoy playing games. The Legend of Zelda
			series is, and always will be a favourite of mine. It is what truely
			got me into enjoying computers. 
			</p>

			<p> Another large interest of mine is crafting.	Lately I have developed 
			a deep interest in crochet. Although I hope to soon try to make lace, 
			making animals is always a favourite of mine.
			</p>
			
			<p> I have been playing soccer since the age of 5. Although taking the current
			season off to focus on my last year of university, I am excited to play next season.
